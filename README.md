About
-----
This is an NEAT project in Space Invaders.

The Space Invaders original source code can be found [here] (https://github.com/leerob/Space_Invaders) : 

The goal of the Neural Network is to get as much score as possible in the game. 
The score can increase when the ship shoots an enemy or if it dodges a bullet that is near him. 


How To Start the Neural Evolution
----
   
 - If you have the correct version of Python and Pygame installed, you can run the program in the command prompt / terminal.
 ``` bash
python space_driver.py
 ```
 **Note:** If you're using Python 3, replace the command "python" with "python3"
